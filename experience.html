                        <h4>Front End Team</h4>
                        <br/>
                        <p> I had an amazing time working with the SpotMeSolutions Team
                            during the Fall of 2018! <br/> <br/> We successfully built a 
                            working version of the application after 4 monthes of work.
                            This is a big accomplishment, as many of us had 
                            little to no prior experience working with JavaScript; much less, React
                            and redux! <br/> <br/> Through working on the team, I learned a lot
                            about what I'm capable of! I developed and improved my skillset, learning
                            new things along the way as well as refining my understanding of stuff I had 
                            already known. <br/> <br/>With that being said, the project was 
                            by no means easy to complete. The biggest challenge that the team faced was merging code and
                            communication. Both problems intertwined with one another as different team members
                            would be working on different things and not communicating that with the others. This resulted
                            in the team stressing out and using time inefficiently. However, the problem was resolved
                            as the guidelines for the project our team was building became more and more clear!
                            <br/> <br/> Although coding the project was challenging and working with team members 
                            was the best, it was worth it. Through working with the SpotMeSolutions team I learned lots 
                            of new things and have grown a fondness for UI/UX design through the process! <br/> <br/>
